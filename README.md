# NDN-multicast
This project consist of three parts: Wireless, NDN, SVC-player.
# Wireless
We modified linux source so that it is possible to set multicast rate.
# NDN
We modified both ndn-cxx and NFD and then built a file transmission tool based on NDN.
# SVC-player
We use SVC-toolchain to merge different layers of .264 video. We use OpenSVCDecoder as svc decoder. And then, based on libSDL2, we build a SVC video player.
