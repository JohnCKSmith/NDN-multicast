First, you need to copy the decoder library here:
    cp ../OpenSVCDecoder/build/libOpenSVCDecoder.so ./libOpenSVCDecoder.so


Then, you need to compile the player library:
    gcc player.c -lSDL2 -fPIC -shared -o libPlayer.so


Finally, copy the video example from ../video_example here and run the demo.py:
    python2 demo.py
