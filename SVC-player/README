Dependency:
  To compile OpenSVCDecoder, you will need SDL, which won't actually be used. To compile the player, you will need SDL2 and SDL2-image, which will be used.
  On ubuntu 20.04:
    sudo apt install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev cmake

First you have to compile and install OpenSVCDecoder:
  cd OpenSVCDecoder
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make  
  sudo cp ./libOpenSVCDecoder.so /usr/lib/libOpenSVCDecoder.so


You can compile and run "demo.cxx":
   g++ demo.cxx merge.cxx player.c -L. -lOpenSVCDecoder -lSDL2 -o demo
   cp ./demo ./video_example/demo
   cd video_example
   ./demo
